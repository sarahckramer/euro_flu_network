### Look at how simulated outbreaks change based on seeding scheme

# Try:
# [] Seed only one random country (or, same random pull of init conditions, run with each country as a start location)
    # [] Seed 1, 10, 50
    # [] Seed based on pop dist, or in home-home compartment only
# [] Select 2, 3, 5 countries to randomly seed

# Evaluate based on:
# [] Number of countries w/ no onset
# [] Median/range of AR
# [] Median/range of PT
# [] AR/PT/OT by country/longitude
# [] Synchrony
